# Goals & Objectives

The aim is to create a solution that:

- **Reduces manual admin work**: Automate repetitive tasks currently done manually
- **Maintains simplicity**: Keep the tool accessible for a non-tech-savvy admin
- **Adds value for members**: Provide a fun, useful tool rather than just another app or website
- **Improves the experience**: Make the process less painful for everyone involved
- **Maintains authenticity**: Keep the solution's charm and avoid feeling overly AI-driven or robotic, ensuring it doesn't alienate users or the admin with automation overload
- **Low cost**: Keep hosting and maintenance costs minimal
- **Maintainable architecture**: Since I'm the only web developer, avoid coupling the solution to my presence. Consider low-cost CMS options like Squarespace, or ensure the Next.js stack can be easily migrated if I leave

And for me personally, as a Frontend Developer who currently despises his day job:

1. I'd like to build something that uses modern technology
2. Something that can potentially help with job search
3. Hopefully learn something
4. Exercise use of AI tooling
5. Utilise some technologies that interesting companies are looking for
