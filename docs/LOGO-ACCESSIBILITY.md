# Logo accessibility suggestions

The current logo uses **white (#FFF)** on **#91d3b9** (mint/teal). That combination does not meet WCAG contrast requirements (roughly 2:1; WCAG AA needs 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and graphics).

## 1. Improve contrast on the logo itself

**Option A – Darken the logo background (recommended)**  
Use a darker green/teal behind the wave and text so white passes:

- **#2d8b6f** or **#268067** – white reaches ~4.5:1 (AA).
- **#1a6b52** or **#156b52** – white reaches ~5.5:1+ (AA, comfortable).

Keep #91d3b9 as a secondary brand colour (borders, accents, light backgrounds). Use the darker shade only in the logo lockup so the mark is readable everywhere (Instagram, WhatsApp, site).

**Option B – Invert for light contexts**  
Provide two lockups:

- **Logo on dark** – white wave + text on #1a6b52 (or similar). Use on light pages and social.
- **Logo on light** – wave + text in #1a6b52 (or #268067) on white. Use on dark pages or when the logo sits on white.

**Option C – Add a subtle outline**  
If you must keep white on #91d3b9, add a thin dark stroke (e.g. 1px #1a6b52) around the wave and text to improve legibility. This helps but usually still won’t reach full AA; treat as a last resort.

## 2. Summary

- **Best path:** Use a darker green/teal (#1a6b52–#2d8b6f) for the logo background or for the logo mark on white, and keep #91d3b9 for UI accents and backgrounds.
- **Contrast check:** After any change, verify with a contrast checker (e.g. WebAIM) that white on the chosen background (or the chosen green on white) meets at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text/graphics.
